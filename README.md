# java-projects

A structured collection of Java console applications developed through object-oriented design principles. The projects demonstrate core software engineering concepts—control flow, abstraction, encapsulation, arrays, and method composition—applied to practical simulations such as payroll computation, geometric modeling, ASCII-based graphics, and interactive decision games.

**Project Included**
## Stat Analysis
**Code:** [Stat.java](./Stat/Stat.java)  

This program performs key statistical computations:mean, median, mode, minimum, and maximum on numerical datasets.  
It demonstrates algorithmic thinking, array manipulation, iterative logic, and method decomposition.  
The project highlights how structured program flow can be used to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

**Run the program:**
```bash
javac Stat/Stat.java
java Stat.Stat
