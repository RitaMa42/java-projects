# java-projects

A structured collection of Java console applications developed through object-oriented design principles. The projects demonstrate core software engineering concepts—control flow, abstraction, encapsulation, arrays, and method composition—applied to practical simulations such as payroll computation, geometric modeling, ASCII-based graphics, and interactive decision games.

**Project Included**
1. Circle Geometry
This program models and compares geometric circles using object-oriented design principles. It defines a Circle class with constructors, encapsulated fields, and overloaded methods to calculate area, diameter, equality, and intersection between circles. The project emphasizes modular structure, abstraction, and class-based design, demonstrating the ability to translate mathematical relationships into well-organized code.
